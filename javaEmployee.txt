1.  Personally I dislike the concept of getters and setters however I understand this is an OOP class!

For the following code I have two issues:
1.  The mis-spaced {} is quite misleading when skimming the code.
2.  This setter should follow suit with the others and contain validation code to make sure that
    it does not recieve any garbage data that could break the program.

Code in question:
"
public void setHireDate(Date origHireDate )
    {
                hireDate = origHireDate;
        }
"

As-is the compiler will throw a fit about not importing the Date class from java.util.Date
I also think that these two classes should be organized into a package.
